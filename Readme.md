 - Change Subject Name when change id
 - Difference between an overwrite and a delete operator
 - Delete whole objects with the delete operator

 - Currently this library only supports the following features of JSON-LD context:
   - "@id",
   - "@type",
   - "@container": "@set"
 - Blank nodes are not supported
 - Array ordering is inconsistent
